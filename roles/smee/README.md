# Ansible Role: Gosmee

This role sets up a Gosmee server using Docker Compose. Gosmee is a webhook forwarder/relayer and replayer that allows you to receive webhooks on your local machine or forward them to internal services that are not publicly accessible.

Project Website: <https://github.com/chmouel/gosmee>

## Features

- Webhook forwarding with secure defaults
- Support for webhook signature validation
- IP address restrictions for webhook POST requests
- Payload size protection (25MB limit by default)
- Channel name protection (64 characters max)
- Integration with reverse proxy

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Running instance of [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) or similar reverse proxy

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

```yaml
# Basic Configuration
smee_path: '/container/smee'
smee_domain: 'smee.{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# Security Features
smee_webhook_signatures: []  # List of secrets for webhook signature validation
smee_allowed_ips: []        # List of allowed IPs/CIDR ranges
```

### IP Restriction Examples

You can restrict webhook POST requests to specific IP ranges. Here are some common examples:

```yaml
# GitHub webhook ranges
smee_allowed_ips:
  - 192.30.252.0/22
  - 185.199.108.0/22
  - 140.82.112.0/20

# GitLab.com webhook ranges
smee_allowed_ips:
  - 35.231.145.151
  - 34.74.90.64
  - 34.74.226.93

# Bitbucket Cloud webhook ranges
smee_allowed_ips:
  - 34.199.54.113
  - 34.232.119.183
  - 34.236.25.177
  - 35.171.175.212
```

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

Basic usage:
```yaml
- name: Gosmee Server Play
  hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: teamapps.general.smee
      vars:
        smee_domain: "smee.example.com"
```

Advanced usage with security features:
```yaml
- name: Gosmee Server Play
  hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: teamapps.general.smee
      vars:
        smee_domain: "smee.example.com"
        smee_webhook_signatures:
          - "your-webhook-secret-1"
          - "your-webhook-secret-2"
        smee_allowed_ips:
          - "192.30.252.0/22"  # GitHub webhook range
          - "35.231.145.151"   # GitLab webhook IP
```

## Usage

After deployment:

1. Access your Gosmee server at `https://your-domain/new` to generate a new channel
2. Use the generated URL as your webhook endpoint
3. The webhook payloads will be forwarded to your specified target

### Channel URLs

Channel URLs follow the format:
```
https://your-domain/RANDOM_ID
```
where RANDOM_ID is a 12-character string containing a-zA-Z0-9_-

### Security Notes

1. The server enforces a 25MB payload size limit (GitHub standard)
2. Channel names are limited to 64 characters
3. When using IP restrictions, only POST requests are affected - UI access remains unrestricted
4. Webhook signatures can be validated using multiple secrets
5. The service automatically trusts proxy headers for proper IP forwarding
